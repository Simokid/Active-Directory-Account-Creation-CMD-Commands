<h1>Overview:  Lab 3 Creating Help Desk Accounts in Active Directory and Using CMD Commands</h1>

This section of my home lab documentation demonstrates the creation of a dedicated **Help Desk account** in **Active Directory (AD)** and managing it using **command-line tools (CMD)**. This task highlights the practical steps involved in provisioning accounts for IT support personnel, ensuring proper permissions, and configurations, and automating the process to streamline account management. Additionally, this project focuses on the administrative tasks that a Help Desk account might handle, such as password resets and user account modifications.

<h2>Objectives</h2>

- Create a specialized **Help Desk account** in Active Directory.
- Use **CMD commands** to verify account creation and configuration.
- Assign appropriate **permissions** to the Help Desk account for administrative tasks.
- Enable the **Recycle Bin** through Active Directory Administrative Center to enhance account recovery processes.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

For this home lab, we will create a Help Desk account with the appropriate permissions for administrative tasks through Active Directory. We will also enable certain features in our Active Directory settings and use specific CMD lines to automate and verify account creation and configuration.

Before creating the Help Desk account, let's begin by enabling the Recycle Bin to restore deleted items if needed. To do this, search for "Active Directory Administrative Center" in the search bar at the bottom left and open it.
